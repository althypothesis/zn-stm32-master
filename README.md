# zn-stm32-master

mbed code for ST NUCLEO-F410RB to act as a master for a ZedNet network. ZedNet is a custom RS845 command-response protocol designed by me and is primarily intended for prop control and/or home automation, but is very general-purpose and flexible in any scenario where one master needs to communicate with a number of slaves on a single half-duplex bus.
