# zn-stm32-master

mbed code for ST NUCLEO-F410RB to act as a master for a ZedNet network. ZedNet is a custom RS845 command-response protocol designed by me and is primarily intended for prop control and/or home automation, but is very general-purpose and flexible in any scenario where one master needs to communicate with a number of slaves on a single half-duplex bus.

## Documentation
Documentation is currently being made up as I go. I have a bit of a living document that will universally be lagging behind the source code, available [here](https://goo.gl/QUT5oA) Once I've started at the code long enough to decide the feature is permanent and in it's final form, and I have some fre time, I'll add it to the document.
